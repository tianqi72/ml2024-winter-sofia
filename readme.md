Create a very simple python program:

The program asks the user for input N (positive integer) and reads it

Then the program asks the user to provide N numbers (one by one) and reads all of them (again, one by one)

In the end, the program asks the user for input X (integer) and outputs: "-1" if there were no such X among N read numbers, or the index (from 1 to N) of this X if the user inputed it before.
